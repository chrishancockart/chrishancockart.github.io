My name is Chris Hancock. I am an artist living and working in the Kansas City area.

My media include acrylic paint, digital print, traditional print, photography, electronics, and mechanics.

My work deals with the relationships between humans and their technology - the sometimes symbiotic, and sometimes parasytic interactions.

The [front page](http://chrishancockart.com) as well as most pages on this site were created using a Markdown editor called [Haroopad](pad.haroopress.com).

The [gallery](http://chrishancockart.com) was created using [Llgal](http://home.gna.org/llgal/).
